Bed Leveling Mount is based on walter's but I did it in OpenSCAD and has arrows for up/down and the thumbwheels are graduated to know how much you have turned. Its handy if you are using something like RRF manual leveling process.

Tensioners are walters remixed to incorporate heatserts that I sourced from trimcraftaviationrc.com

Z Motor Bracket- I goofed on my belts. I needed another bracket configuration- this lets you reroute the belt to get some tensions on it a bit better
