Bed Leveling Mount is based on walter's but I did it in OpenSCAD and has arrows for up/down.

Tensioners incorporate heatserts that I sourced from trimcraftaviationrc.com

Endstops are remixed brackets for the usual Makerbot 3 wires endstops. 

Jigs are bits that I made to make spotting of holes and tapping the extrusions
